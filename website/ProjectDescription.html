            <h1>Project Description:</h1>

            <p1>
              Our awesome client, Gretchen McCallister, Ph.D., works hard to
              coordinate the C & I Ph.D. program and ensure that proper educators
              emerge from the program. A masters graduate student has 8 years to
              complete a plethora of milestones until they reach candidacy:
                  <ul>
                    <li>60 graduate level course units</li>
                    <li>A Qualifying Research Paper</li>
                    <li>Two Comprehensive Exams</li>
                    <li>Other Professional Development</li>
                    <li>Dissertation</li>
                  </ul>
              Currently, all the graduate students&apos; completed milestones
              are being stored locally on one computer. If a graduate student
              wants to inquire about a completed milestone, they must email the
              faculty member managing all the local data which can be a time
              consuming and stressful interaction for both parties involved.
              Team What&apos;s Up Doc is aiming to alleviate the stress of both
              students and faculty by creating a faculty accessible desktop app
              intended for data entry that will ultimately interface with each
              graduate student through an intuitive and approachable website
              application. Through this website application, graduate students
              will have access to instant feedback on their progress in the Ph.D.
              program and be able to view milestones in progress, view milestones
              completed and receive notes of encouragement along the way.
